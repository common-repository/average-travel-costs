Displays average daily travel costs from Budget Your Trip.

== Description ==
This plugin allows a blog or website to display average daily travel costs and prices from Budget Your Trip. These travel costs are calculated from travel expenses submitted by tens of thousands of real travelers. The expenses are then averaged and aggregated to create the costs for cities and countries around the world.

The average costs are displayed as a new **Gutenberg block** or a **sidebar widget**, displaying the embeddable travel costs found on Budget Your Trip\'s website. The embeded travel costs can be displayed at any width.
